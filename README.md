# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of the new analysis is to provide more information on the city types and how they compare to one another.  After combining two sets of data, Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per Driver were calculated and grouped by city type.  Then total fares per week were graphed by city type.  Using this information, we will be able to provide information to the CEO and shareholders to address any needed changes. 
## Results
When comparing each city type against each other we find that on average the Rural city types average higher fares per ride and per driver, second would be Suburban city types in both categories.  There are factors that can contribute to this that have not been explored but could include total trip distance and total trip time. 

We find that there are significantly more drivers in the Urban cities and those cities contribute over half of all revenue. In the Rural and Suburban cities each driver is responsible for 1.6 and 1.2 rides each respectively.  In Urban cities that number drops to .67 rides.   


| Total Rides | Total Drivers | Total Fares | Average Fare per Ride | Average Fare per Driver |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rural |	125 |	78 |	$4,327.93 |	$34.62 |	$55.49 |
| Suburban |	625	| 490 |	$19,356.33 |	$30.97 |	$39.50 |
| Urban |	1,625 |	2,405 |	$39,854.38 |	$24.53 |	$16.57 |

When comparing Total Fare by City Type weekly from Jan 2019 to end of Apr 2019, we find that Urban cities have an average increase in weekly Total Fares over the time frame.  Suburban cities were consistently the same except for a peak at the end of Feb then returned to normal, but in the last two weeks of Apr we see a large increase.  Rural cities have shown consistency in weekly Total Fares with a few peak weeks.  As with the Total Fares, weekly total fares are consistent with Urban cities leading the total fares followed by Suburban and Rural cities respectively

## Summary
Considering the result findings above, I would recommend three business strategies moving forward. 

The first would be to reduce the number of drivers in the Urban cities.  The data above shows that drivers in Rural and Suburban cities can support more than one ride per driver.  Cutting the number or drivers based on performance will help to increase overall satisfaction of customers and increase usage.  This should help to increase revenue as Urban cities contribute the most revenue.  

The second would be to increase the driver counts in both Rural and Suburban cities.  With the average fare being higher in each of these city types, increasing driver count will result in an increase in total fares at a higher rate.  

The third strategy would be to increase the fares in the Urban cities.  Doing so will not impact the customer as much as it would in the rural and suburban cities and most rides are shorter distance.  But this will help to compensate drivers and increase overall revenue.
